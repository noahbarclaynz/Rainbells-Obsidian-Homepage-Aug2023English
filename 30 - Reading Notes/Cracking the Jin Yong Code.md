Epigraph:

In Jin Yong's novels, there are many characters with names starting with "不" (bù), such as Bao Butong, Boping Daoren, Zhuo Bufan in "Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils," Ding Busang, Ding Busi in "The Proud Twins," Ni Buda, Ni Buxiao in "The Young Flying Fox," Feng Bucui, Feng Bupo in "The Crimson Sabre," and there's also one called "Saidude" in "The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber." 

Naming characters with "不" (bù) is a practice with an ancient flavor.

During the Warring States period, there were historical figures with names starting with "不," such as Shen Buhai, Lv Buwei, Ren Buqi, Mi Buqi, Han Buxin, Chen Buzhan, Xiao Buyi, Gongshan Buning, Gongcheng Buren, etc. In the Han dynasty, there were figures like Liang Buyi, Jun Buyi, Zhi Buqi, Cheng Bushi, Gao Bushi, Gongshang Buhai, etc.

Characters with names starting with "不" (bù) are concentrated in the novel "Smiling Proud Wanderer." Under the Huashan Sect, there are Yue Buqun, Feng Buping, Cheng Buyou, and Cong Buqi.

The daughter of the "Jianghu wanderer" is known as "Lao Busi."

> "Linghu Chong wondered, 'What? The old man's daughter is named Fangming Busi, so she's called "Lao Busi"? Ah, I see... It's good luck to live to old age and be called "Lao Busi." She is of the "Bu" generation, the same generation as my master.' The more he thought about it, the more amusing it became."

The Huashan Sect has a strong Confucian influence, and the names of its disciples like "Buqun" and "Buyou" are derived from Confucian classics like "Analects" (as mentioned below).

There are few female disciples under the Huashan Sect, and they are not named with "Bu," but rather with "Zhong." If there were other female disciples in the Huashan Sect (perhaps they died in the internal conflict at the "Jade Maiden Peak"), their names should also include "Zhong."

"Zhong" is highly valued in Confucianism. I believe that "Zhong" in Ning Zhongze's name is the "Zhong" in "Zhongyong" (Doctrine of the Mean) and "Zhongxing" (loyalty and honesty).

**Sun, Moon, Stars, Sunflower, Ruo (Black) Wood** - Sun, Moon Cult, Absorbing Stars Great Skill, Black Wood Cliff (Ling), Sunflower Manual; these are the five symbols of the Evil Cult. Sun, Moon, Wood, and Sunflower all revolve around the "Sun," serving as their center, their foundation.

The other beliefs of the Sun and Moon Cult are long gone, but their most important belief is exceptionally clear: they consider the sect leader as the incarnation of the "Sun" and sing praises to him.

Also known as the "Evil Cult," Jin Yong can have Zhang Wuji join the Ming Cult, but he would never have Linghu Chong join the Sun and Moon Cult. Zhang and Linghu share similar personalities, but their attitudes toward the "Evil Cult" are vastly different because Ming Cult and Sun and Moon Cult fundamentally differ.

The biggest difference between the Sun and Moon Cult and the Ming Cult lies in their strong and institutionalized personal worship of the sect leader:

"Mother Dingjing knew that in the Evil Cult, everyone, from top to bottom, regards the sect leader as a deity. If anyone insults the name of the sect leader, the cult members would come out and defend the sect leader's reputation with their lives. This is a grave offense." (Three-Union version of "The Smiling Proud Wanderer," page 893).

**Sun, Moon, Sunflower** - Buddhism has the Three Jewels of Buddhism; Daoism speaks of "one giving birth to two, two giving birth to three, and three giving birth to all things"; Christianity has the doctrine of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, a "trinity." The Sun and Moon Cult also has its own "trinity": Sun, Moon, and Sunflower.

"The Sunflower Manual" is the treasure of the Sun and Moon Cult and plays a dual role in the establishment of the new generation's core leadership, serving as both a "Royal Seal" and a "Secret Strategy."

Master Chongxu said, "The martial arts world has always said that 'The Sunflower Manual' was written by a eunuch in the former palace." What is the greatest professional ethics of a eunuch? It is servility and loyalty. As Cao Zhi said, "If the sunflower tilts its leaves, even though the sun may not shine back at it, it still ultimately turns towards the sun. " A eunuch names the martial arts he created after "Sunflower" quite naturally.

This eunuch identifies himself as a sunflower, and the sun in his heart can only be the emperor. In "The Deer and the Cauldron," there is a poem by Cha Shenxing with the line "He appears as a crimson cloud, always accompanying the sun," referring to Wei Gonggong's wish to work and fight for the great leader, Emperor Kangxi.

After various twists and turns, this book eventually falls into the hands of the Evil Cult, and it is also destined. Therefore, the cult is called the "Sun and Moon Cult," and it is not difficult to imagine a red sun shining in their minds.
